title: "From Pixels to Protection: GIS Decision Support Tool for Conservation Planning"
description: "Developed a fully customizable GIS decision support tool for the Haliburton
Highlands Land Trust to prioritize conservation areas within the Highlands Corridor initiative.
The tool uses weighted overlay analysis to integrate remote sensing data, including NDVI
change detection to identify vegetation degradation, allowing the land trust to dynamically adjust
conservation priorities based on funding availability, stakeholder input, and changing
environmental conditions. This tool is now actively used to prioritize land acquisition and
stewardship efforts across Crown land, unceded territory, and private holdings connecting three
provincial parks (Queen Elizabeth II Wildlands, Frost Centre, Silent Lake). Awarded the J.
Emmett Duff Memorial Prize in Geography."
