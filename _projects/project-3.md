title: "Traditional Rights of Way Mapping: Kennisis Lake Portage System"
description: "Conducted cadastral analysis and GIS mapping to identify Traditional Rights of
Way (TROW) encroachment by cottage developments in the Kennisis Lake area. Assessed
zoning by-laws and parcel fabric to propose new portage access routes within the Gull River
system. Consulted Registry Act and Land Titles Act processes, using historical abstracts and
title searches to determine current tenure and easement conditions. The resulting shapefile and
ESRI StoryMap have been adopted by Tourism Haliburton and local stakeholders to inform
regional portage route planning and protect Indigenous access rights."
